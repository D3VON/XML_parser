Assignment 2
Advanced Object Oriented Programming

B Number: B00135581

---->this is my second submission, much improved.

This assignment is unfinished.  I intend to submit a better version
at a later date.

         - Please run 'make'
         - Then run 'parser_test'  

Problems:
========
1. I can't solve memory leaks.  Don't know how.
2. Parser lets 'bad' xml go when it should fail.

Note: 
====
My program seems to work adequately on 'big1.xml', but fails with 'text.xml'.  --it used to work with that one, but stopped recently.
 
"GOOD" EXAMPLE OUTPUT USING 'big1.xml'
=====================================

remote11:~/cs440_Adv_OOP/assign2_xml_parser> ./parser_test -f test_code/good_xml/big1.xml > out

remote11:~/cs440_Adv_OOP/assign2_xml_parser> cat out | tail
                  End: :test9
                End: :test8
              End: :test7
            End: :test6
          End: :test5
        End: :test4
      End: :test3
    End: :test2
  End: :test1
